# Landing Page Update: Creative Suite Focus

## Summary
The GoogleHubs landing page has been completely reimagined to lead with the platform's most unique and compelling features: AI-powered content creation, movie production, and monetization capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hero Section Transformation

**Before:**
```
Your All-in-One AI-Powered Business Hub
Replace 15+ tools with GoogleHubs. CRM, automation, content creation,

Write Your Book.
Create Your Movie.
Sell Tickets to the Premiere.

Think you can write a book? HELIX AI helps you create articles, manuscripts,
children's books, and full-length movies. Convert your script into a cinematic
experience, host premieres, and monetize your creativity—all in one platform.
Plus CRM, automation, and prospecting tools to grow your business.
```

**Why This Works:**
