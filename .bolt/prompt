6. **Free Trial:** 14 days with no credit card removes friction
7. **Affiliate Program:** Incentivizes word-of-mouth growth

### Technical Decisions
1. **FastAPI + React:** Modern, fast, scalable stack

   **Solution:** Start with manual 911 dial, add API integration later

3. **Challenge:** AI costs can be high
   **Solution:** Use emergentintegrations for cost-effective access to multiple models

4. **Challenge:** Mobile experience is critical for field workers
   **Solution:** Prioritize mobile app development in Q2 2025
